-- Introduction/Basic Story of Application --
This application shows what time it currently is in various places around the globe. It's purpose it to be able to grasp differences in time at a quick glance. 

-- Core Features --
Upon landing on the page you will first see the nav bar. In the nav bar you have the ability to click on the "home", "search", "clocks list", and "add clock" elements in order to be redirected to the to that specific component of the website. By default, all components will be displayed on the page, which is also equal to the "home" route in the nav bar.

The second core feature is the one contained in the Header, which is the showcase clock. This clock is set to New York by default. By clicking anywhere within the header, the user can toggle the background image, as well as the font color of the city name and time, to reflect a night-time setting, or vice versa to day-time. 

The third core feature of this application is the Search component. This allows users to type into the allotted search field and filter through all clocks to find a specific one. 

The fourth core feature is a list of all the clocks contained in the database. In this list we can see a variety of cities, all styled with their skyline as a background image. That background image has been programmed to show the night-time skyline if the actual time in that local is between the hours of 7pm and 7am. All of the clocks contained in this component can replace the featured clock in the Header with a simple click. 

The fifth and final core feature is the submission form. This feature allows users to submit a new clock and post it to the database. User's will need to type in the name of the city, select the timezone it is in from the 24 options povided in a drop-down menu, and add a day-time image of that city, as well as a night-time one. Once added, the user submitted clock will be subject to all the same features as the other clocks in the database, as have been listed above.
